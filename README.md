# Student Habits Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes how different student habits affect academic performance. Using the `student_habits_performance.csv` dataset, the notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling. The goal is to identify key factors influencing exam scores and build predictive models.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **File**: `student_habits_performance.csv`  
- **Target Variable**: `exam_score`  
- **Features**: Includes both numerical and categorical variables related to student habits (e.g., study hours, sleep patterns, extracurricular activities).  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Scale numerical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Histograms of features  
   - Correlation heatmap to detect relationships  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Separation of target (`exam_score`) from predictors  

4. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  

5. **Evaluation**
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - RÂ² Score

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Visual insights from EDA highlight correlations between habits and performance.  
- Random Forest generally provides higher predictive accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
